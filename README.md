# Konteramatt
Popular Luxemburgish Card Game
Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konter_a_Matt

December 1st 2024:
- Currently i have basic functioning classes and game logic that isnt implemented into the database yet
- The databse with basic display of cards is up and running

1) I use and understand git for updating the code. (git init, git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git status and git log)
9) My project is build with Maven. The generated .war files are utilized by Apache Tomcat connected to the MySql database. (see Kontermatt folder)
12) I use IntelliJ for code development. My favorite shortcuts are "2xShift -> Search Everywhere","Ctrl+Space -> Code Completion" and "Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T -> Refactor". I'm also playing around with neovim and I might switch in the future.
15) I set up ChatGPT inside IntelliJ but I might switch to a different one later.

TASKS
22 Oct: Name, little Coding Project (little description) and a link to your public GitHub [5 Points]
01st Dec: First Deliverable of everything with good content via Email (see edlich.de) [15 Points]
20th Jan: Final GitHub with all Tasks!!
A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. The code in GitHub can be relatively simple (e.g., a game with console output). The doc can be short! (in contrast to the one below)
B) Make sure each person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture:
1) Use and understand GIT, and be able to apply the basic commands. Can you experiment with time travelling or branches/merges? E.g. add some screenshots, add a paragraph text or show by reference/link into the commits, that you applied all the commands.
2) UML: at least 3 big different diagrams. "big" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all the tools to view them! For example, these diagrams are a good idea: Use-Case, Component D, Class D, and Activity Diagram.
3) REQUIREMENTS: Create 5-10 good requirements for your project. Then put them into a simple tool (like Airtable, Notion or Trello) and a professional tool (like Monday, Jira, Doors, ObjectIF, Xebrio, etc.) Instead of the professional version, you can also build a tool yourself; e.g. with AI! If you have used AI / LLMs here, briefly describe where and how! However, it is more important here that some / many attributes are used!
4) ANALYSIS: A) Think about your checklist (on an extra A4 page) from all the points of the ‘ANA - Analysis’ learning unit, with the points that you consider relevant for your project (e.g. 10-15 instead of 30 on the overall picture) B) Carry out an analysis of your semester project / your favourite project. Or have a start-up idea and would like to hand in the start-up analysis as part of a large documentary! There should be at least 2 pages. Take the 10-15 points from the checklist (with e.g. 1-2 paragraphs per point). Assume that you will soon have a fishing rod for the start-up chapter. If you are successful, you would receive a lot of ‘money’ in order to be allowed to design and implement it later. So get your start-up off to a successful start!The use of large language models is explicitly encouraged here! However, don't try to solve everything with one prompt and then submit 10 pages: get specific help!
Provide the prompts in brackets that have helped you to improve or structure something here! Please find the sweet spot between your own work/testing and content generation in order to learn something yourself throughout the entire process!
5) A) DDD: (A) Do an Event-Storming to find your Domains! If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio € from Edlich-Investment!) (B). Drop your Domains into a Core Domain Chart (C) and indicate the Relations = Mappings (! see MIRO examples again) between the Domains in a new diagram!
6) METRICS: at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine. Run the tools, document the output with screenshots, and explain what these Metrics or e.g. style errors mean!
7) CLEAN CODE DEVELOPMENT: A) At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.
8) REFACTORING: Show me two (non-trivial) Refactoring Examples of your code! Showing the original content and the refactored code! Explain what happened, why and how it has improved! Again: do not send me pure AI work!
9) BUILD Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could also be disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) => to be merged with 7!
10) CONTINOUS DELIVERY: show me your pipeline using e.g. Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. E.g. you can also use Jenkins Pipelining or BlueOcean, etc. But at least insert more than 2 script calls as done in the lecture! (e.g. also call Ant or Gradle or something else).
11) Integrate some nice UNIT TESTS in your Code to be integrated into the Build!
12) Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. VSCode, IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!
13) AI Coding: Set Up an AI-coding environment on your computer like ZED, Aider, free Cursor / Windsurf programs, etc. Show your steps and personal experiences! (ref)
14) FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING: prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
only final data structures
(mostly) side-effect-free functions
the use of higher-order functions
functions as parameters and return values
use closures / anonymous functions
You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.


The complete documentation must be found in a public GitHub or the system you use.
For B) Please give me a hint as a checklist for each numbered 1-13 points (!!!): where I can find the info for your solutions best as links (!) in the README.md !! (e.g. to code)
It must explain also part B in 1-2 paragraphs per point! So list the 11 numbered points here and use links here to refer to the respective files (e.g. the CCD files or test files)!
The contribution in Moodle is just a Link to GitHub in the comment section!
- I want your personal experiences with Screenshots and personal text!
