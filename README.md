# Konteramatt
Popular Luxemburgish Card Game
Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konter_a_Matt

December 1st 2024:
- Currently i have basic functioning classes and game logic that isnt implemented into the database yet
- The databse with basic display of cards is up and running

1) I use and understand git for updating the code. (git init, git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git status and git log)
9) My project is build with Maven. The generated .war files are utilized by Apache Tomcat connected to the MySql database. (see Kontermatt folder)
12) I use IntelliJ for code development. My favorite shortcuts are "2xShift -> Search Everywhere","Ctrl+Space -> Code Completion" and "Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T -> Refactor". I'm also playing around with neovim and I might switch in the future.
15) I set up ChatGPT inside IntelliJ but I might switch to a different one later.
