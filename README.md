## Project Overview

### A) Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a multiplayer, web-based adaptation of the Luxembourgish card game "Konter a Matt" in Java. Since I greatly enjoy playing it in real life and no online version currently exists, this project aims to bring the game to a broader audience by providing an accessible digital experience.

**Github Copilot Plugin**

The installation was pretty straightforward. I went into the Intellij Plugin section, installed Copilot and logged in with my Github Account. After, I registered for the free trial. The ability to use AI directly inside my IDE was a gamechanger. Before, I always used ChatGPT inside the browser but now I use Copilot exclusively after adding it to my stack.
